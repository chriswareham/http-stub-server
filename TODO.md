# TODO List

 * Support for blocking assertions (ie, wait for a matching request to come in for a period of time)
 * Better (easier to read) logging, maybe not just log4j/JULI logging (specialised log)
 * Add matches/near misses to UI
 * Support filtering requests via query parameters (eg, '?method=POST')
 * Create form in UI for creating stubbed responses
 * Acceptance tests...
 * Tool for bulk-loading messages
 * Example Scala/other? client code for interacting with stub.

Github TODO:
 - Add some downloadable artefacts?
 - Document JavaScript support
 - Document filtering support (/_control/requests?method=GET&path=...)
